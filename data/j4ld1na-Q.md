## [01] - Shorthand way to write `if` / `else` statement.

1. Increases readability
2. Shortens the overall SLOC

_The normal `if` / `else` statement can be refactored in a shorthand way to write it:_

There are 2 instances:

[contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L92-L101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L92-L101)

```java
        if (totalShares == 0) {
            newShares = amount;
        } else {
            uint256 priorTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() - amount;
            if (priorTokenBalance == 0) {
                newShares = amount;
            } else {
                newShares = (amount * totalShares) / priorTokenBalance;
            }
        }
```

change to:

```java
        if (totalShares == 0) {
            newShares = amount;
        } else {
            uint256 priorTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() - amount;
            newShares = priorTokenBalance == 0 ? amount : (amount * totalShares) / priorTokenBalance;
        }
```

```java
 if (priorTotalShares == amountShares) {
            amountToSend = _tokenBalance();
        } else {
            amountToSend = (_tokenBalance() * amountShares) / priorTotalShares;
        }
```

change to:

```js
amountToSend = priorTotalShares == amountShares ? _tokenBalance(); : (_tokenBalance() * amountShares) / priorTotalShares;
```

## [02] - Don't use of `Block.Timestamp` can be manipulated.

There an instance:

[Docs](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/block-timestamp-manipulation/)
_Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts._

[contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L262-L265](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L262-L265)

```ts
require(expiry >=
    block.timestamp, 'StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategyWithSignature: signature expired');
```

Recommended Mitigation Steps:

-   Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbersâ€”i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.
-   Time-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts (time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry dates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with a 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks. Thus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can be more secure, as miners are unable to easily manipulate the block number.
