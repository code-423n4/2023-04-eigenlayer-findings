a) Pausable.sol
   modifier whenNotPaused() and function pauseAll() could have used the two constants declared in the contract which was declared for the same purpose.

  constants:
  ==========
  uint256 constant internal UNPAUSE_ALL = 0;
  uint256 constant internal PAUSE_ALL = type(uint256).max;
  
  modified as 
  /// @notice Throws if the contract is paused, i.e. if any of the bits in `_paused` is flipped to 1.
  modifier whenNotPaused() {
     require(_paused == UNPAUSE_ALL, "Pausable: contract is paused");
        _;
  } 


  function pauseAll() external onlyPauser {
        _paused = PAUSE_ALL;
        emit Paused(msg.sender, type(uint256).max);
  }


b) EigenPodManager.createPod() and stake has duplication of logic related to, if the msg.sender has a pod.

instead, in the stake function could leverage hasPod() to check if pod does not exist, create one
and then retreive the pod and stake on that pod.
  
function stake(bytes calldata pubkey, bytes calldata signature, bytes32 depositDataRoot) external payable {
      if(!hasPod(msg.sender)){
         _deployPod()
      }
      
      IEigenPod pod = ownerToPod[msg.sender];
      pod.stake{value: msg.value}(pubkey, signature, depositDataRoot);
    }

c) Use of Assembly needs special review as it bypasses solidity compiler.
