issue with the function withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH as it is not marked as non-reentrant, which can allow a malicious user to re-enter the function before the execution of the transaction is complete.

Description:
The function withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH is used to transfer ETH to a specified recipient address. However, the function is not marked as non-reentrant, which means that it can be re-entered before the transaction execution is complete. This could lead to an attack where a malicious user can repeatedly call the function before the transaction is complete, causing the recipient to receive more ETH than expected.

Impact:
The impact of this issue could be significant as it can cause the recipient to receive more ETH than intended, which can result in financial losses.

Recommendation:
To mitigate this issue, the withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH function should be marked as non-reentrant using the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard library.

Example Solution:


import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract EigenPod is ReentrancyGuard {

  // ...

  function withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    // function body
  }

  // ...

}
