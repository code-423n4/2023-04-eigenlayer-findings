In the function `depositIntoStrategyWithSignature` of `StrategyManager.sol` there is a check of `adress(0)` and `amount` but for that we have to loop throught 3 functions which will cost alot of gas so it is better use the check for `amount` and `adress(0)` at the start, instead of looping through all the contracts and reverting
