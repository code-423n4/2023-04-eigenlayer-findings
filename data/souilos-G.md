++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for and while-loops. Moreover ++i costs less gas than i++, especially when its used in for-loops (--i/i-- too).

### Mitigation 

In such cases, initializing the variables with default values would be unnecessary and can be considered a waste of gas. Additionally, initializing variables with default values can sometimes lead to unnecessary storage operations, which can increase gas costs. For example, if you have a large array of variables, initializing them all with default values can result in a lot of unnecessary storage writes, which can increase the gas costs of your contract.

### Mitigation 

Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.

### Mitigation 

Mark data types as calldata instead of memory where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as calldata. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies memory storage.










# VULN 7 

## Cache array length outside of loop

### Mitigation 

If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

### Mitigation 

Using assembly to check for the zero address can result in significant gas savings compared to using a Solidity expression, especially if the check is performed frequently or in a loop. However, it's important to note that using assembly can make the code less readable and harder to maintain, so it should be used judiciously and with caution.

### Mitigation 

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html. Each operation involving a uint8 costs an extra 22-28 gas (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type uint8) as compared to ones involving uint256, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the uint8, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

When you use the += operator on a state variable, the EVM has to perform three operations: load the current value of the state variable, add the new value to it, and then store the result back in the state variable. On the other hand, when you use the = operator and then add the values separately, the EVM only needs to perform two operations: load the current value of the state variable and add the new value to it. Better use <x> = <x> + <y> For State Variables.

### Mitigation 

Instead of using address(this), it is more gas-efficient to pre-calculate and use the hardcoded address. Foundryâ€™s script.sol and solmateâ€™s LibRlp.sol contracts can help achieve this.

    uint32 constant disputePeriodBlocks = 1 days / 12 seconds;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Due to how constant variables are implemented (replacements at compile-time), an expression assigned to a constant variable is recomputed each time that the variable is used, which wastes some gas.










# VULN 15 

## Using private rather than public for constants, saves gas

Found in line 56 at 2023-04-eigenlayer/src/contracts/pods/EigenPod.sol:

    uint256 public immutable REQUIRED_BALANCE_WEI;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where itâ€™s used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Using double require instead of operator && can save more gas. When having a require statement with 2 or more expressions needed, place the expression that cost less gas first.
